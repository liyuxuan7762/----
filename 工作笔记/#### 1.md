#### 1. Clarify the business requirement

As far as I understand, when scanning the orders that contains "PSPEL" field in the WAS screen, a new button should be displayed in the low right coroner in order to show the files in the path given by the "PSPEL" field via IDoc. Besides, if the "PSPEL" field does not exist, the button should be invisible.

**Q1: What is the full path of the folder needs to be displayed?**

> The Prefix of the fixed path is always the same and the suffix is delivered via IDOC.

**Q2: Which part is the fixed prefix and which part is delivered by IDoc?**

**Q3: How can I access the folder directly via Windows Explorer since I need to check the these files?**

#### 2. Technical Questions

**Q1: How to add a new button in the WAS?**

The following steps have already been done:

- `css` `view.xml` `controller.js` have been created
  
- Add the new plugin in `config.xml`
  

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root>
	<plugins>
		<infobar path="cpxContent/plugins/customViews/cpxInfobar"></infobar>
		.....
		<rightDynamicDetails path="cpxContent/plugins/customViews/dynamicDetailSection">
				<documentlist path="cpxContent/plugins/dynamicPlugins/documentlist" fullscreen="false"></documentlist>
				......
                <!-- Newly added plugin-->
				<fileList path="cpxContent/plugins/dynamicPlugins/fileList" fullscreen="false"></fileList>
		</rightDynamicDetails>
	</plugins>
</root>
```
> Q: What is the path `cpxContent/plugins/dynamicPlugins/fileList`, couldn't find it in the Eclipse explorer. 

- Add configurations in `pluginconfiguration.xml`
```xml
<plugin>
    <pluginName>FILE_LIST_PLUGIN</pluginName>
    <pluginDetectionClass>com.th.me.plugins.fileListPlugin.FileListPlugin</pluginDetectionClass>
    <pluginViewXML>cpxContent/plugins/fileList</pluginViewXML>
    <pluginViewCSS>./cpxContent/css/fileList.css</pluginViewCSS>
    <pluginViewIcon>sap-icon://open-folder</pluginViewIcon>
    <fullscreen>false</fullscreen>
    <priority>6</priority>
    <targetArea>LOWER_RIGHT_CENTER</targetArea>
    <autoConfirm>false</autoConfirm>
    <operationPlugin>false</operationPlugin>
    <showInProcessPanel>true</showInProcessPanel>
</plugin>
```
* Create the plugin Java class

```java
package com.th.me.plugins.fileListPlugin;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;

@Path("/fileListPlugin")
public class FileListPlugin {

}
```

**Q2: How to get the "PSPEL" field of the scanned order? In Java code and via Xml file**
As mentioned in the description, the final path of the 3.2 folder is obtained by combining the fixed prefix and the suffix given by the "PSPEL" field. Therefore, the question is how to get the "PSPEL" field in order to get the full path. 


**Q3: How to stimulate the whole business process?**
* Create an order in the ERP side and assign a value to the "PSPEL" field
* Transport the newly created order to ME?
* Scan the order in the WAS
* Check if the button works fine


**Q4: Do we have some examples of accessing file via path in Java code?**
